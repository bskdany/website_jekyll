Hey!

I'm just a guy that somehow got involved with computers and everything that has to do with them.

Right now I'm experimenting with random stuff trying to find what I like, in the past two years I did an android app, a game in unity, web scrapers, trading bots with the lean engine, websites, a chess robot, setup servers etc

At this moment I mainly code in python but I have knowledge of Javascript, Java, C# and Arduino C.

If you want to have a more detailed look of the stuff I do you contact me [here](mailto:buissness@bskdany.com)<br />
